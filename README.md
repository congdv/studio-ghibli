# Studio Ghibli 

I'm a fan of studio Ghibli, I've watched most of movies of studio ghibli since I was young.

So I decided to build this web app from [this api](https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/)

Tech Stack:
- React
- Redux Saga

# Run locally

```
yarn && yarn start
```

# My thought

I'm more familiar with Redux-thunk, so I want to do something new, so I picked Redux-Saga for learning purpose.
